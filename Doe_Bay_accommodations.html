      <h1> Stay with Us </h1>
      <h1> Cabin, Yurt or Tent? What's Your Pleasure? </h1>
      <h2> From a rustic studio cabin to a 3-bedroom deluxe cabin, we have
      something to match everyone’s budget, group size, and amenities
      preference.
      </h2>
        <p>Rustic Cabins – While being our most basic cabin type, these waterless cabins
      are our most economical, heated indoor spaces. Woodstoves provided in select
      rustic accommodations.
        </p>
        <p>Deluxe Cabins – Providing an additional level of comfort, our Deluxe Cabins
         are equipped with a bathroom and kitchen (or kitchenette). Most of our Central
         Deluxe Cabins offer some of the best views on the property!
        </p>
        <p>Group Cabins – Harbor House and Retreat House are best suited for (but not
        limited to) family reunions, wedding parties, workshops, and retreats,
        offering the home-like comforts necessary for meal preparation, dining and
        entertainment.
